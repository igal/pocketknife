pocketknife is a devops tool for managing computers running chef-solo, powered by Opscode Chef.

Using pocketknife, you create a project that describes the configuration of your computers and then deploy it to bring them to their intended state.

With pocketknife, you don't need to setup or manage a specialized chef-server node or rely on an unreliable network connection to a distant hosted service whose security you don't control, deal with managing chef's security keys, or deal with manually synchronizing data with the chef-server datastore.

With pocketknife, all of your cookbooks, roles and nodes are stored in easy-to-use files that you can edit, share, backup and version control with tools you already have.
